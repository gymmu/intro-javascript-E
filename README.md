# Introduction to Javascript

This repository provides an introduction to Javascript. All basic information is already available, and you can start working with Javascript directly. There are also tests that you can use to check whether a task has been solved correctly.

## Exercises

Here you will find a collection of tasks to help you learn Javascript.

### Exercise 1

Find the `sayHello()` function and change its name. The test should now fail. Change the name of the function back so that the test passes.

Execute the `sayHello()` function.

### Exercise 2

Find the `changeBackground()` function and modify the value so that the test fails. Then, modify the function to create a background color of your choice.

Execute the function by pressing a button.

### Exercise 3

Create a function `deleteText()` and an HTML element with the ID `to-delete`. Bind the `deleteText()` function to a button.

The `deleteText()` function should set the content of the `#to-delete` element to 'content deleted'.

All tests for Exercise 3 must pass.

### Exercise 4

Create an HTML element with the ID `counter` and set its value to 0. Create a function `incrementCounter()`. This function should read the content of `#counter` and increase the value by one.

Bind the `incrementCounter()` function to a button.

### Exercise 5

Create the function `decrementCounter()`, which decreases the value of the `#counter` element by one.

### Exercise 6

Create the function `resetCounter()`. This function should set the counter to 0. Bind this function to a button.

### Exercise 7

Create a text input field with the ID `input` and a `pre` element with the ID `output`. Also, create a function `writeText()`. This function should read the value from `#input` and append it to `#output`.

### Exercise 8

Create your own simple tasks that you can solve with your current knowledge. Describe the task in HTML and write a function to solve your task. You can also use other elements for this purpose.

### Exercise 9

Take notes on what you have learned and where you still face challenges. Write down what you have learned and your notes in the HTML file as well.
